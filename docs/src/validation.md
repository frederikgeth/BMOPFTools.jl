# Validating the OPF engine

BMOPFTools ships a reference nonlinear four-wire IVR-EN OPF ([`solve_opf`](opf.md)) used to
validate cases and profile solutions. A reference solver is only as useful as its
own validation, so this page documents **how that engine is tested** — both so you
can judge the results and so you can **reuse the setup for your own tool**. 

The goal of our implementation is to be consistent with generally accepted circuit modeling practice
in the presence of nonlinear elements, including but not limited to constant power loads. We generally
trust OpenDSS's implementation correctness, however, modelers may disagree on
what appropriate models are. In this context, we recommend to study the paper "A perspective on transformer 
modeling for distribution system analysis", with full bibliographic details below. 

Two questions every distribution-OPF engine must answer, and the suite tests each
separately:

1. **Is the solution a valid power flow?** — *feasibility*: do the solved
   voltages and currents actually satisfy Kirchhoff's laws and the component
   models? We check this against **OpenDSS**.
2. **Is it the optimum?** — *optimality*: given the objective and the operating
   bounds, does the optimizer reach the right dispatch? We check this against
   **closed-form solutions** and against **PowerModelsDistribution (PMD)**. 
   Note that we don't claim global optimality, just local. 

The philosophy is the one stated in [the OPF formulation](opf.md): the accuracy of
the network physics matters more than any single objective, so feasibility is
validated exhaustively and component-by-component, while optimality is pinned to
independently-derived optima.

If you are building your own engine there are **two ways to reuse this**: adopt
the *harness* (the `.dss` cases and the comparison method), or adopt the
*locked-in numbers* (the objective and voltage baselines tabulated below) as
regression targets. The test files are the source of truth; the tables here
reproduce their headers.

## Feasibility — agreement with OpenDSS

Source: [`test/powerflow_comparison_tests.jl`](https://github.com/frederikgeth/BMOPFTools.jl/blob/main/test/powerflow_comparison_tests.jl)
(24 testsets) over the 18 OpenDSS cases in
[`test/data/pf_comparison/`](https://github.com/frederikgeth/BMOPFTools.jl/tree/main/test/data/pf_comparison).

### The method: a power flow expressed as a feasibility OPF

There is no separate power-flow solver to validate — instead each case is solved
with [`solve_feasibility_opf`](opf.md#Feasibility-relaxation), which adds an
**elastic slack current** at every non-source terminal and minimises its squared
norm. When the optimal slack is ≈ 0, every KCL/KVL and component-model constraint
is satisfied exactly, so the solution *is* a valid power flow:

```julia
res     = solve_feasibility_opf(net; optimizer = Ipopt.Optimizer)
slack_A = res["total_slack_magnitude_A"]
@test slack_A < 1e-3          # the network balances with no injected slack
```

The same network is then solved in OpenDSS through OpenDSSDirect.jl, and the
complex node voltages are compared one-to-one. OpenDSS is solved *live* at test
time — there are no stored golden voltages; the `.dss` files themselves are the
immutable baseline (see [Voltage source as current slack](opf.md#source-slack)
for how the source/slack convention is matched).

The node-name mapping bridges the two conventions:

| OpenDSS node | BMOPF terminal |
|---|---|
| `bus.1` / `bus.2` / `bus.3` | `1` / `2` / `3` (phases) |
| `bus.4` | `n` (neutral) |
| `bus.0` | earth reference — skipped |

### Tolerances and their rationale

The voltage comparison (`_cmp_volts`) uses, verbatim from the test header:

| Case class | `atol` | `rtol` | Rationale |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Lines, lossless / lightly-loaded transformers | 1.0 V | 1e-3 | sub-volt agreement on a ~240 V base |
| 3-phase transformers, realistic losses, ≥ 70 % loading | 0.1 V | 1e-3 | at 75 % on a 500 kVA / 0.415 kV unit the LV-side series drop is ≈ 10 V, so 0.1 V demands < 1 % model agreement — any wrong sign, missing factor, or wrong impedance side shows up as > 1 V |

Two further checks back up the voltage match: the feasibility slack
(`< 1e-3 A`), and total transformer losses against OpenDSS (`rtol = 0.05`). The
tolerances are deliberately tight enough to catch a single modelling error, not
merely "close".

### What the cases isolate

Each `.dss` file is a minimal 2-bus-style fixture that isolates one modelling
concern, so a failure points straight at the responsible component:

| Case file | Isolates |
|---|---|
| `pf_1ph_line`, `pf_3ph_line` | single- and three-phase line series impedance, unbalanced 4-wire loads |
| `pf_1ph_freeneutral`, `pf_1ph_impedanceneutral`, `pf_1ph_perfectneutral` | neutral grounding: floating, grounding-reactor (Z = 0.2 Ω), and perfectly grounded |
| `pf_zip_1ph`, `pf_zip_3ph`, `pf_zip_delta`, `pf_exp_1ph`, `pf_delta_load` | voltage-dependent load models — ZIP (distinct P/Q fractions), exponential (γ), and delta (line-to-line) connection |
| `pf_1ph_xfmr`, `pf_yd_xfmr`, `pf_dy_xfmr`, `pf_center_tap_xfmr` | transformer windings/vector groups: YY, Yd, Dy, and split-phase center-tap |
| `pf_autotransformer`, `pf_open_delta_reg` | step-voltage regulators / autotransformers and open-delta (ABBC) regulation |
| `pf_pv_1ph`, `pf_pv_4leg` | inverter current injection at a pinned dispatch — single-phase and FOUR_LEG |

Single-phase, FOUR_LEG per-phase, and FOUR_LEG AVERAGE-reference **smart-inverter
droop** are additionally validated against OpenDSS `InvControl` (deadband, slope,
and saturation regimes) within the same file.

### Reusing the feasibility setup

The `.dss` files are portable and engine-agnostic: point your own solver at a
case, solve the same `.dss` in OpenDSS for the reference voltages, and compare
node-by-node with the mapping and tolerances above. No BMOPFTools dependency is
needed to reuse the baseline.

## Optimality — agreement with known optima

Feasibility proves the physics; optimality proves the optimizer reaches the right
point. Three complementary tiers, each with a different source of truth.

### Tier 1 — closed-form analytic targets

Source: [`test/opf_tests.jl`](https://github.com/frederikgeth/BMOPFTools.jl/blob/main/test/opf_tests.jl).
Tiny networks whose optimum is solvable by hand, so the target is exact rather
than borrowed. For a single-phase resistive feeder the load-bus voltage is the
root of the power-flow quadratic

$$V = \frac{V_s + \sqrt{V_s^2 - 4RP}}{2},$$

and dispatch/cost tests pin the objective directly:

| Test | Analytic target | Tolerance |
|---|---|---|
| T1 — single-phase resistive | `V = (V_s + √(V_s² − 4RP))/2 ≈ 947.214 V` | 0.01 V |
| T3 — forced generator dispatch | `V ≈ 974.342 V`, `objective = cost·P_gen` | 0.01 V / 0.1 |
| T4 — negative cost ⇒ `p_max` binding | each phase at `p_max = 50 kW`, `objective = −3·P_max` | 1.0 W / 10 |
| T5 — power-balance identity | `P_source = P_load + P_line_loss` | 0.1 W |
| T10 — sequence voltage bounds | tight `vneg_max`/`vzero_max` ⇒ balanced `V_phase = vpos_max` | 5.0 V |

The suite also pins per-unit ⇄ SI agreement, immutability of the input network,
and the result-dictionary contract (see [the result schema](results.md)).

### Tier 2 — golden objectives ported from PowerModelsDistribution

Source: [`test/pmd_opf_port_tests.jl`](https://github.com/frederikgeth/BMOPFTools.jl/blob/main/test/pmd_opf_port_tests.jl).
These fixtures rebuild PMD's small OPF test networks directly in BMOPF's native
schema (no PMD dependency) and assert the **published PMD objective** — the slack
injection summed over phases, reported as `voltage_source[...]["ps"|"qs"]`. The
2/3-bus cases target PMD's `IVRUPowerModel` (the formulation closest to BMOPF's
current-voltage engine); the 4/5-bus and delta cases target PMD's AC formulations,
whose objectives are formulation-independent.

**Locked-in baseline** (reuse these as regression targets; `atol = 1e-2 kW/kvar`
unless noted):

| Case | Σ pg (kW) | Σ qg (kvar) | PMD reference |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 2-bus diagonal | 18.209 | 0.208 | `opf_iv.jl` (IVR) |
| 3-bus balanced | 18.345 | 9.194 | `opf_iv.jl` (IVR) |
| 3-bus unbalanced | 21.4812 | 9.27263 | `opf_iv.jl` (IVR) |
| 4-bus phase drop | 18.2632 | 9.02334 | `opf.jl` (AC) — also pins load-bus voltages |
| 5-bus phase drop | 59.9363 | −33.5395 | `opf.jl` (AC) — also pins mid-bus voltages |
| 3-bus delta + ZIP | 42.0464 | 18.1928 | `opf.jl` (AC) — `atol = 1.0 kW/kvar`, voltage-dependent |

Each fixture rebuilds the network from the underlying OpenDSS source that PMD
ships (`case{2_diag,3_balanced,3_unbalanced,4_phase_drop,5_phase_drop,3_unbalanced_delta_loads}.dss`),
so the chain is OpenDSS case → BMOPF schema → BMOPF OPF → PMD objective.

### Tier 3 — droop optimization correctness

Source: [`test/volt_var_watt_tests.jl`](https://github.com/frederikgeth/BMOPFTools.jl/blob/main/test/volt_var_watt_tests.jl).
The smart-inverter Volt-var / Volt-watt droop is encoded as constraints *inside*
the OPF (see [Smooth droop encoding](relu_softplus_encoding.md) and the
[VVWO tutorial](tutorial_vvwo.md)). These tests check the optimizer lands on the
droop curve in every regime:

- **Volt-watt** — active power binds to the curtailment cap at the solved voltage
  (`atol = 5 W`) once the droop region is active (`V > 253 V`);
- **Volt-var** — reactive power follows the four-point characteristic, absorbing
  near `V4` (`atol = 5 var`) and ≈ 0 in the deadband (`|Q| < 30 var`);
- **voltage reference** — `PER_PHASE` gives three distinct per-phase `Q`'s on an
  unbalanced bus while `AVERAGE` gives one common `Q` (the contrast the VVWO
  tutorial's appendix shows), plus the exact-vs-smooth encoding agreement as the
  corner-smoothing `ε → 0` (`atol = 2e-3`).

## Reusing this for your own tool

| You want to … | Use | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| validate your power-flow / component models | the `.dss` cases + a live OpenDSS solve, compared as above | the network physics is correct |
| validate your optimizer | the Tier-1 analytic targets and the Tier-2 PMD objective table as regression checks | the optimizer reaches the true optimum |
| validate smart-inverter control | the Tier-3 droop setpoints | control laws are enforced as modelled |

The two reuse paths are complementary: the analytic and PMD numbers are
*self-contained* baselines (copy the table, no dependency), while the `.dss`
feasibility cases need an OpenDSS solve to regenerate the reference — which is the
point, since OpenDSS is the de-facto distribution power-flow oracle.

## Running the suite

The OPF and OpenDSS tests are optional dependencies, guarded in
[`test/runtests.jl`](https://github.com/frederikgeth/BMOPFTools.jl/blob/main/test/runtests.jl):

- the optimality tests (`opf_tests.jl`, `pmd_opf_port_tests.jl`,
  `volt_var_watt_tests.jl`) run when JuMP + Ipopt are present (`_HAS_JUMP_IPOPT`);
- the feasibility comparison (`powerflow_comparison_tests.jl`) additionally needs
  OpenDSSDirect.jl (`_HAS_ODS`).

When a dependency is absent the relevant testset is `@test_skip`-ped rather than
failed, so the core suite runs anywhere. Run everything from the package root:

```
julia --project=. -e "using Pkg; Pkg.test()"
```
