## 8. Spec Conformance & Benchmark Readiness

| Spec conformance | Value |
|------------------|------:|
| Conformance issues | 0 |
| Voltage sources (spec requires 1) | 1 |

| Structural integrity | Value |
|----------------------|------:|
| Reference issues | 0 |
| Dimension issues | 0 |
| Galvanic islands | 3 |
| Islands without voltage reference | 1 |

| Benchmark readiness | Value |
|---------------------|------:|
| Objective well-posed | true |
| Only slack generation | true |
| Buses with \|V\| bounds | 0.0% |
| Buses with vpn / vpp / vsym bounds | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| Lines with thermal limits | 0.0% |

**Augmentation needed:**

- only slack generation — dispatch is trivial (loss minimisation); add dispatchable DERs with diverse costs and p/q bounds
- no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground)
- no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vsym_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF

> 🔴 **[E.INT.NO_VOLTAGE_REFERENCE]** Galvanic island of 1 bus(es) has no voltage reference (no source, perfect grounding, or grounding shunt) — voltages are defined only up to a shift (rank-deficient): b2650.

> 🔵 **[I.BENCH.AUGMENTATION]** Case needs augmentation to be a non-trivial OPF benchmark: only slack generation — dispatch is trivial (loss minimisation); add dispatchable DERs with diverse costs and p/q bounds; no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground); no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vsym_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF.
