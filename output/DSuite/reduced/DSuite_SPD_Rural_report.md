> 🟡 **[W.PROV.IMPLICIT_GROUNDING]** No branch carries a neutral conductor, but 29 bus(es) have components referencing terminal 'n' without an explicit grounding — the model implicitly assumes every bus is grounded (Kron-style convention). Make this assumption explicit.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.WYE_NEUTRAL_UNGROUNDED]** Transformer 'dist_transformer_14216629_9089776' (delta_wye) brings out a three-phase wye neutral on its secondary side at bus '9089776', but that bus has no local grounding (no perfect ground and no grounding impedance). The star point's zero-sequence potential is set only by what the neutral conductor reaches elsewhere — add a grounding shunt or perfect ground at '9089776' if a local earth was intended.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.DSS_DEFAULT_LENGTH]** 1 of 54 line(s) have length exactly 1.0 among otherwise varied lengths — the OpenDSS default; these lengths were likely never set.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.IMPEDANCE_TRANSFORM_KR]** 64 three-wire linecode(s) match the impedance signature of Kron reduction — neutral row/column eliminated from the original four-wire Carson impedance matrix via Schur complement. Exact when every neutral is perfectly grounded; approximate with finite grounding.

## 8. Spec Conformance & Benchmark Readiness

| Spec conformance | Value |
|------------------|------:|
| Conformance issues | 0 |
| Voltage sources (spec requires 1) | 1 |

| Structural integrity | Value |
|----------------------|------:|
| Reference issues | 0 |
| Dimension issues | 0 |
| Galvanic islands | 2 |
| Islands without voltage reference | 0 |
| Line impedance spread | 2.08e10× |

| Benchmark readiness | Value |
|---------------------|------:|
| Objective well-posed | false |
| Only slack generation | false |
| Buses with \|V\| bounds | 0.0% |
| Buses with vpn / vpp / vpos bounds | 0 / 0 / 0 |

| Generators with zero cost (dispatchable) | 0 |
| Same-cost generator pairs (≤1 hop) | 0 |

**Augmentation needed:**

- no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs
- no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground)
- no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF

> 🟡 **[W.INT.LOW_IMPEDANCE_LINE]** 4 line(s) have total series impedance below 10⁻³× the network median — they degrade NLP conditioning; model them as lossless switches: 11545351, 7095819, 7095820, 7095821.

> 🔵 **[I.BENCH.AUGMENTATION]** Case needs augmentation to be a non-trivial OPF benchmark: no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs; no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground); no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF.

  17 linecode(s) have exactly balanced impedance matrices (equal self, equal mutual entries) — likely constructed from sequence parameters (r1,x1,r0,x0) or a transposition assumption, not from conductor geometry: _line_sourcez, cable_230v_0.05_cu, cable_230v_185_al_wavef, cable_230v_240_al_consac, cable_230v_25_al_acs, cable_230v_25_al_act, cable_230v_25_al_ascs, cable_230v_25_al_asct, cable_230v_300_al_wave, cable_230v_35_al_acs, cable_230v_35_al_act, cable_230v_35_al_ascs, cable_230v_35_al_asct, cable_230v_35_al_hybrid, default, unknown_lv_cable_m, unknown_lv_ohline_m.
- **[I.PROV.DECOUPLED_PHASES]** `linecode`  
  47 linecode(s) have zero mutual coupling (diagonal impedance matrix) — positive-sequence-only data; the phases decouple into independent single-phase networks: busbar, cable_230v_0.0125_al, cable_230v_0.0125_cu, cable_230v_0.0225_cu, cable_230v_0.025_cu, cable_230v_0.03_al, cable_230v_0.04_al, cable_230v_0.04_cu, cable_230v_0.06_al, cable_230v_0.06_cu, cable_230v_0.15_al, cable_230v_0.15_cu, cable_230v_0.1_al, cable_230v_0.1_cu, cable_230v_0.25_al, cable_230v_0.25_cu, cable_230v_0.2_al, cable_230v_0.2_cu, cable_230v_0.3_al, cable_230v_0.3_cu, cable_230v_0.5_al, cable_230v_0.5_cu, cable_230v_16_cu, cable_230v_185_al, cable_230v_185_al_wave, cable_230v_25_al, cable_230v_25_cu, cable_230v_25_cu_cscs, cable_230v_25_cu_csct, cable_230v_300_al_consac, cable_230v_300_cu, cable_230v_35_cu_ccs, cable_230v_35_cu_cct, cable_230v_35_cu_cscs, cable_230v_35_cu_csct, cable_230v_4_cu, cable_230v_95_al, cable_230v_95_cu, connector, ohl_230v_0.0225_ocu, ohl_230v_0.05_oal, ohl_230v_25_oal, ohl_230v_35_abc, ohl_230v_50_abc, ohl_230v_50_oal, unknown_lv_cable_s, unknown_lv_ohline_s.
- **[I.PROV.PARTIAL_PI_SHUNT]** `linecode`  
  63 of 64 linecode(s) have no π-shunt admittance — mixed model: some lines are series-only, others include shunt capacitance/conductance: busbar, cable_230v_0.0125_al, cable_230v_0.0125_cu, cable_230v_0.0225_cu, cable_230v_0.025_cu, cable_230v_0.03_al, cable_230v_0.04_al, cable_230v_0.04_cu, cable_230v_0.05_cu, cable_230v_0.06_al, cable_230v_0.06_cu, cable_230v_0.15_al, cable_230v_0.15_cu, cable_230v_0.1_al, cable_230v_0.1_cu, cable_230v_0.25_al, cable_230v_0.25_cu, cable_230v_0.2_al, cable_230v_0.2_cu, cable_230v_0.3_al, cable_230v_0.3_cu, cable_230v_0.5_al, cable_230v_0.5_cu, cable_230v_16_cu, cable_230v_185_al, cable_230v_185_al_wave, cable_230v_185_al_wavef, cable_230v_240_al_consac, cable_230v_25_al, cable_230v_25_al_acs, cable_230v_25_al_act, cable_230v_25_al_ascs, cable_230v_25_al_asct, cable_230v_25_cu, cable_230v_25_cu_cscs, cable_230v_25_cu_csct, cable_230v_300_al_consac, cable_230v_300_al_wave, cable_230v_300_cu, cable_230v_35_al_acs, cable_230v_35_al_act, cable_230v_35_al_ascs, cable_230v_35_al_asct, cable_230v_35_al_hybrid, cable_230v_35_cu_ccs, cable_230v_35_cu_cct, cable_230v_35_cu_cscs, cable_230v_35_cu_csct, cable_230v_4_cu, cable_230v_95_al, cable_230v_95_cu, connector, default, ohl_230v_0.0225_ocu, ohl_230v_0.05_oal, ohl_230v_25_oal, ohl_230v_35_abc, ohl_230v_50_abc, ohl_230v_50_oal, unknown_lv_cable_m, unknown_lv_cable_s, unknown_lv_ohline_m, unknown_lv_ohline_s.
- **[I.PROV.WYE_NEUTRAL_UNGROUNDED]** `dist_transformer_14216629_9089776`  
  Transformer 'dist_transformer_14216629_9089776' (delta_wye) brings out a three-phase wye neutral on its secondary side at bus '9089776', but that bus has no local grounding (no perfect ground and no grounding impedance). The star point's zero-sequence potential is set only by what the neutral conductor reaches elsewhere — add a grounding shunt or perfect ground at '9089776' if a local earth was intended.
- **[I.PROV.DSS_DEFAULT_LENGTH]** `line`  
  1 of 54 line(s) have length exactly 1.0 among otherwise varied lengths — the OpenDSS default; these lengths were likely never set.
- **[I.PROV.IMPEDANCE_TRANSFORM_KR]** `linecode`  
  64 three-wire linecode(s) match the impedance signature of Kron reduction — neutral row/column eliminated from the original four-wire Carson impedance matrix via Schur complement. Exact when every neutral is perfectly grounded; approximate with finite grounding. Zero-sequence behaviour is not captured by the three-wire representation.: _line_sourcez, busbar, cable_230v_0.0125_al, cable_230v_0.0125_cu, cable_230v_0.0225_cu, cable_230v_0.025_cu, cable_230v_0.03_al, cable_230v_0.04_al, cable_230v_0.04_cu, cable_230v_0.05_cu, cable_230v_0.06_al, cable_230v_0.06_cu, cable_230v_0.15_al, cable_230v_0.15_cu, cable_230v_0.1_al, cable_230v_0.1_cu, cable_230v_0.25_al, cable_230v_0.25_cu, cable_230v_0.2_al, cable_230v_0.2_cu, cable_230v_0.3_al, cable_230v_0.3_cu, cable_230v_0.5_al, cable_230v_0.5_cu, cable_230v_16_cu, cable_230v_185_al, cable_230v_185_al_wave, cable_230v_185_al_wavef, cable_230v_240_al_consac, cable_230v_25_al, cable_230v_25_al_acs, cable_230v_25_al_act, cable_230v_25_al_ascs, cable_230v_25_al_asct, cable_230v_25_cu, cable_230v_25_cu_cscs, cable_230v_25_cu_csct, cable_230v_300_al_consac, cable_230v_300_al_wave, cable_230v_300_cu, cable_230v_35_al_acs, cable_230v_35_al_act, cable_230v_35_al_ascs, cable_230v_35_al_asct, cable_230v_35_al_hybrid, cable_230v_35_cu_ccs, cable_230v_35_cu_cct, cable_230v_35_cu_cscs, cable_230v_35_cu_csct, cable_230v_4_cu, cable_230v_95_al, cable_230v_95_cu, connector, default, ohl_230v_0.0225_ocu, ohl_230v_0.05_oal, ohl_230v_25_oal, ohl_230v_35_abc, ohl_230v_50_abc, ohl_230v_50_oal, unknown_lv_cable_m, unknown_lv_cable_s, unknown_lv_ohline_m, unknown_lv_ohline_s.
- **[I.PROV.LINE_SWITCH_LIKE]** `11545351`  
  Line '11545351' has near-zero series impedance and may be modelled more accurately as a switch: effective impedance (Z·length) < 0.0001 Ω on all diagonals.
- **[I.PROV.LINE_SWITCH_LIKE]** `7095819`  
  Line '7095819' has near-zero series impedance and may be modelled more accurately as a switch: effective impedance (Z·length) < 0.0001 Ω on all diagonals.
- **[I.PROV.LINE_SWITCH_LIKE]** `7095820`  
  Line '7095820' has near-zero series impedance and may be modelled more accurately as a switch: effective impedance (Z·length) < 0.0001 Ω on all diagonals.
- **[I.PROV.LINE_SWITCH_LIKE]** `7095821`  
  Line '7095821' has near-zero series impedance and may be modelled more accurately as a switch: effective impedance (Z·length) < 0.0001 Ω on all diagonals.
- **[I.PRE.NO_VOLT_BOUNDS]** `bus`  
  55 bus(es) have no voltage bounds — voltage will be unconstrained at these buses.
- **[I.PRE.SINGLE_SOURCE]** `network`  
  Network has a single voltage source — single point of failure. Infeasibility of the source makes the entire network infeasible.
- **[I.SCHEMA.VERSION_UNKNOWN]** `network`  
  Spec version 'unknown' has no bundled JSON Schema; structural validation skipped. Unknown-field catalogue still runs.
- **[I.SCHEMA.UNKNOWN_FIELDS]** `bus`  
  bus has field(s) not in the BMOPF schema: latitude, longitude.
- **[I.SCHEMA.UNKNOWN_FIELDS]** `network`  
  meta has field(s) not in the BMOPF schema: reference, source.
- **[I.DOM.LINE_IMPEDANCE_SPREAD]** `line`  
  Adjacent lines '8539453' and '7095821' at bus '17439334' have ||Z||_F ratio 53600.0× — large impedance contrasts between neighbouring lines cause ill-conditioned KKT Jacobians; consider per-unit scaling or network reformulation.
- **[I.RED.MERGEABLE_LINES]** `line`  
  7 group(s) of series lines (14 lines total) can be merged — intermediate buses have no other connections.
- **[I.RED.UNUSED_LINECODES]** `linecode`  
  51 linecode(s) defined but not referenced by any line.
- **[I.RED.DUPLICATE_LINECODES]** `linecode`  
  8 group(s) of linecodes share identical R_series_1_1/X_series_1_1.
- **[I.BENCH.AUGMENTATION]** `network`  
  Case needs augmentation to be a non-trivial OPF benchmark: no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs; no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground); no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF.
- **[I.BENCH.LOAD_ZERO_PNOM]** `load`  
  39 load(s) have p_nom = 0 on all phases — these loads impose no real power demand: load_10637594, load_10952551, load_10952568, load_10952569, load_10960343, load_10983375, load_10987351, load_10987352, load_11022643, load_11056295, load_11056946, load_11089750, load_11434169, load_11526642, load_11754850, load_11834427, load_12004807, load_12121550, load_12219819, load_12295316, load_12298311, load_12447746, load_12491308, load_13284933, statcom_13212201_1, statcom_13212201_2, statcom_13212201_3, statcom_13221537_1, statcom_13221537_2, statcom_13221537_3, statcom_14522889_1, statcom_14522889_2, statcom_14522889_3, statcom_17439336_1, statcom_17439336_2, statcom_17439336_3, str_9089776_1, str_9089776_2, str_9089776_3.
