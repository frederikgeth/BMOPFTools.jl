|----|--------|---------------:|
| dist_transformer_10148922_9108515 | 750.0 kVA | 9.9% |

> 🟡 **[W.OPS.IMPORT_DEPENDENT]** Network is heavily import-dependent: local generation capacity (0.0 MW) is less than 5% of total load (0.07 MW).
> 🔵 **[I.OPS.UNLOADED_PHASE]** Galvanic zone anchored at bus 'sourcebus' has no load connected to phase terminal 'a'.

> 🔵 **[I.PROV.PARTIAL_PI_SHUNT]** 63 of 64 linecode(s) have no π-shunt admittance — mixed model: some lines are series-only, others include shunt capacitance/conductance: busbar, cable_230v_0.0125_al, cable_230v_0.0125_cu, cable_230v_0.0225_cu, cable_230v_0.025_cu, cable_230v_0.03_al, cable_230v_0.04_al, cable_230v_0.04_cu, cable_230v_0.05_cu, cable_230v_0.06_al, cable_230v_0.06_cu, cable_230v_0.15_al, cable_230v_0.15_cu, cable_230v_0.1_al, cable_230v_0.1_cu, cable_230v_0.25_al, cable_230v_0.25_cu, cable_230v_0.2_al, cable_230v_0.2_cu, cable_230v_0.3_al, cable_230v_0.3_cu, cable_230v_0.5_al, cable_230v_0.5_cu, cable_230v_16_cu, cable_230v_185_al, cable_230v_185_al_wave, cable_230v_185_al_wavef, cable_230v_240_al_consac, cable_230v_25_al, cable_230v_25_al_acs, cable_230v_25_al_act, cable_230v_25_al_ascs, cable_230v_25_al_asct, cable_230v_25_cu, cable_230v_25_cu_cscs, cable_230v_25_cu_csct, cable_230v_300_al_consac, cable_230v_300_al_wave, cable_230v_300_cu, cable_230v_35_al_acs, cable_230v_35_al_act, cable_230v_35_al_ascs, cable_230v_35_al_asct, cable_230v_35_al_hybrid, cable_230v_35_cu_ccs, cable_230v_35_cu_cct, cable_230v_35_cu_cscs, cable_230v_35_cu_csct, cable_230v_4_cu, cable_230v_95_al, cable_230v_95_cu, connector, default, ohl_230v_0.0225_ocu, ohl_230v_0.05_oal, ohl_230v_25_oal, ohl_230v_35_abc, ohl_230v_50_abc, ohl_230v_50_oal, unknown_lv_cable_m, unknown_lv_cable_s, unknown_lv_ohline_m, unknown_lv_ohline_s.
> 🟡 **[W.PROV.IMPLICIT_GROUNDING]** No branch carries a neutral conductor, but 89 bus(es) have components referencing terminal 'n' without an explicit grounding — the model implicitly assumes every bus is grounded (Kron-style convention). Make this assumption explicit.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.WYE_NEUTRAL_UNGROUNDED]** Transformer 'dist_transformer_10148922_9108515' (delta_wye) brings out a three-phase wye neutral on its secondary side at bus '9108515', but that bus has no local grounding (no perfect ground and no grounding impedance). The star point's zero-sequence potential is set only by what the neutral conductor reaches elsewhere — add a grounding shunt or perfect ground at '9108515' if a local earth was intended.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.DSS_DEFAULT_LENGTH]** 2 of 177 line(s) have length exactly 1.0 among otherwise varied lengths — the OpenDSS default; these lengths were likely never set.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.IMPEDANCE_TRANSFORM_KR]** 64 three-wire linecode(s) match the impedance signature of Kron reduction — neutral row/column eliminated from the original four-wire Carson impedance matrix via Schur complement. Exact when every neutral is perfectly grounded; approximate with finite grounding.

## 8. Spec Conformance & Benchmark Readiness

| Spec conformance | Value |
|------------------|------:|
| Conformance issues | 0 |
| Voltage sources (spec requires 1) | 1 |

| Structural integrity | Value |
|----------------------|------:|
| Reference issues | 0 |
| Dimension issues | 0 |
| Galvanic islands | 2 |
| Islands without voltage reference | 0 |
| Line impedance spread | 1.01e10× |

| Benchmark readiness | Value |
|---------------------|------:|
| Objective well-posed | false |
| Only slack generation | false |
| Buses with \|V\| bounds | 0.0% |
| Buses with vpn / vpp / vpos bounds | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| Lines with thermal limits | 100.0% |
| Generators with no DOF (p\_min≈p\_max) | 0 |
| Generators with zero cost (dispatchable) | 0 |
| Same-cost generator pairs (≤1 hop) | 0 |
| Loads with zero p\_nom | 45 |

**Augmentation needed:**

- no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs
- no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground)
- no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF

> 🟡 **[W.INT.LOW_IMPEDANCE_LINE]** 8 line(s) have total series impedance below 10⁻³× the network median — they degrade NLP conditioning; model them as lossless switches: 11559424, 11559434, 11559435, 11559440, 7236246, 7355059, 7355061, 7368994.

> 🔵 **[I.BENCH.AUGMENTATION]** Case needs augmentation to be a non-trivial OPF benchmark: no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs; no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground); no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF.

  Transformer 'dist_transformer_10148922_9108515' (delta_wye) brings out a three-phase wye neutral on its secondary side at bus '9108515', but that bus has no local grounding (no perfect ground and no grounding impedance). The star point's zero-sequence potential is set only by what the neutral conductor reaches elsewhere — add a grounding shunt or perfect ground at '9108515' if a local earth was intended.
- **[I.PROV.DSS_DEFAULT_LENGTH]** `line`  
  2 of 177 line(s) have length exactly 1.0 among otherwise varied lengths — the OpenDSS default; these lengths were likely never set.

- **[I.PRE.NO_VOLT_BOUNDS]** `bus`  
  178 bus(es) have no voltage bounds — voltage will be unconstrained at these buses.
- **[I.PRE.SINGLE_SOURCE]** `network`  
  Network has a single voltage source — single point of failure. Infeasibility of the source makes the entire network infeasible.
- **[I.SCHEMA.VERSION_UNKNOWN]** `network`  
  Spec version 'unknown' has no bundled JSON Schema; structural validation skipped. Unknown-field catalogue still runs.
- **[I.SCHEMA.UNKNOWN_FIELDS]** `bus`

  8 group(s) of linecodes share identical R_series_1_1/X_series_1_1.
- **[I.BENCH.AUGMENTATION]** `network`  
  Case needs augmentation to be a non-trivial OPF benchmark: no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs; no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground); no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF.
