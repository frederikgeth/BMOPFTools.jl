> 🔵 **[I.DIV.LOAD_UNIFORM_MODEL]** All 85 loads use the constant_power model — no load exercises voltage dependence (ZIP/exponential); the case does not test voltage-dependent load behaviour.
> 🔵 **[I.DIV.LOAD_UNIFORM_CONFIG]** All 85 loads share the 'SINGLE_PHASE' configuration — no connection diversity.

## 5. Loading & Operational Summary

| | Value |
|--|-------|
| Total load P | 77.539 kW |
| Total load Q | 25.5 kvar |
| Total gen capacity | 0.0 W |
| Generation/load ratio | 0.0% |

> 🟡 **[W.OPS.IMPORT_DEPENDENT]** Network is heavily import-dependent: local generation capacity (0.0 MW) is less than 5% of total load (0.08 MW).

## 6. Infeasibility Pre-flight

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Import dependent | true |
| Constraint conflicts | 0 |
| Buses without voltage bounds | 2496 |
| Single point of failure | true |
| TPIA status | not_run |

> 🔵 **[I.PRE.NO_VOLT_BOUNDS]** 2496 bus(es) have no voltage bounds — voltage will be unconstrained at these buses.
> 🔵 **[I.PRE.SINGLE_SOURCE]** Network has a single voltage source — single point of failure. Infeasibility of the source makes the entire network infeasible.

## 7. Provenance & Model Conventions

| Neutral grounding | Value |
|-------------------|------:|
| Buses with neutral | 86 |
| Neutral branches | 0 |
| Grounding points | 1 |
| Neutral sections | 86 |
| Floating sections | 0 |

**Linecode impedance classification:**

|---------|------:|
| distinct | 8 |

**OpenDSS default fingerprints:** 1 hit(s) — see findings

**Earthing system per galvanic zone:**

| Zone | Buses | Wires | Star point | Downstream earths | Likely system |
|------|------:|-------|------------|------------------:|---------------|
| 240.0 V | 2496 | ≤3-wire | solid | 0 | indeterminate (3-wire / Kron-style implicit grounding) |

> 🔵 **[I.PROV.NO_PI_SHUNT]** All 8 linecode(s) have no π-shunt admittance (G_from/B_from/G_to/B_to absent or zero) — the line model reduces to a series impedance only. Shunt capacitance is typically negligible for short LV cables but may be significant for long MV/HV lines.
> 🟡 **[W.PROV.IMPLICIT_GROUNDING]** No branch carries a neutral conductor, but 85 bus(es) have components referencing terminal 'n' without an explicit grounding — the model implicitly assumes every bus is grounded (Kron-style convention). Make this assumption explicit.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.DSS_DEFAULT_LENGTH]** 1 of 2495 line(s) have length exactly 1.0 among otherwise varied lengths — the OpenDSS default; these lengths were likely never set.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.IMPEDANCE_TRANSFORM_KR]** 8 three-wire linecode(s) match the impedance signature of Kron reduction — neutral row/column eliminated from the original four-wire Carson impedance matrix via Schur complement. Exact when every neutral is perfectly grounded; approximate with finite grounding. Zero-sequence behaviour is not captured by the three-wire representation.: LC1, LC2, LC3, LC4, LC5, LC6, LC8, LC9.

## 8. Spec Conformance & Benchmark Readiness

| Spec conformance | Value |
|------------------|------:|
| Conformance issues | 0 |
| Voltage sources (spec requires 1) | 1 |

| Structural integrity | Value |
|----------------------|------:|
| Reference issues | 0 |
| Dimension issues | 0 |
| Galvanic islands | 1 |
| Islands without voltage reference | 0 |
| Line impedance spread | 4400.0× |

| Benchmark readiness | Value |
|---------------------|------:|
| Objective well-posed | false |
| Only slack generation | false |
| Buses with \|V\| bounds | 0.0% |
| Buses with vpn / vpp / vpos bounds | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| Lines with thermal limits | 100.0% |
| Generators with no DOF (p\_min≈p\_max) | 0 |
| Generators with zero cost (dispatchable) | 0 |
| Same-cost generator pairs (≤1 hop) | 0 |
| Loads with zero p\_nom | 0 |

**Augmentation needed:**

- no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs
- no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground)
- no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF

> 🔵 **[I.BENCH.AUGMENTATION]** Case needs augmentation to be a non-trivial OPF benchmark: no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs; no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground); no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF.

## 9. Data Quality Summary

**Total findings:** 809 (0 errors, 225 warnings, 584 info)

### 🟡 Warnings

- **[W.CONN.DANGLING]** `bus`  
  101 bus(es) are degree-1 with no attached load, generator, or shunt.
- **[W.OPS.IMPORT_DEPENDENT]** `network`  
  Network is heavily import-dependent: local generation capacity (0.0 MW) is less than 5% of total load (0.08 MW).
- **[W.PROV.IMPLICIT_GROUNDING]** `network`  
  No branch carries a neutral conductor, but 85 bus(es) have components referencing terminal 'n' without an explicit grounding — the model implicitly assumes every bus is grounded (Kron-style convention). Make this assumption explicit.

### 🔵 Info

- **[I.DIV.LOAD_UNIFORM_MODEL]** `load`  
  All 85 loads use the constant_power model — no load exercises voltage dependence (ZIP/exponential); the case does not test voltage-dependent load behaviour.
- **[I.DIV.LOAD_UNIFORM_CONFIG]** `load`  
  All 85 loads share the 'SINGLE_PHASE' configuration — no connection diversity.
- **[I.PROV.NO_PI_SHUNT]** `linecode`  
  All 8 linecode(s) have no π-shunt admittance (G_from/B_from/G_to/B_to absent or zero) — the line model reduces to a series impedance only. Shunt capacitance is typically negligible for short LV cables but may be significant for long MV/HV lines.
- **[I.PROV.DSS_DEFAULT_LENGTH]** `line`  
  1 of 2495 line(s) have length exactly 1.0 among otherwise varied lengths — the OpenDSS default; these lengths were likely never set.
- **[I.PROV.IMPEDANCE_TRANSFORM_KR]** `linecode`  
  8 three-wire linecode(s) match the impedance signature of Kron reduction — neutral row/column eliminated from the original four-wire Carson impedance matrix via Schur complement. Exact when every neutral is perfectly grounded; approximate with finite grounding. Zero-sequence behaviour is not captured by the three-wire representation.: LC1, LC2, LC3, LC4, LC5, LC6, LC8, LC9.

- **[I.PRE.NO_VOLT_BOUNDS]** `bus`  
  2496 bus(es) have no voltage bounds — voltage will be unconstrained at these buses.
- **[I.PRE.SINGLE_SOURCE]** `network`  
  Network has a single voltage source — single point of failure. Infeasibility of the source makes the entire network infeasible.
- **[I.SCHEMA.VERSION_UNKNOWN]** `network`  
  Spec version 'unknown' has no bundled JSON Schema; structural validation skipped. Unknown-field catalogue still runs.

  205 group(s) of series lines (2360 lines total) can be merged — intermediate buses have no other connections.
- **[I.BENCH.AUGMENTATION]** `network`  
  Case needs augmentation to be a non-trivial OPF benchmark: no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs; no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground); no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF.
