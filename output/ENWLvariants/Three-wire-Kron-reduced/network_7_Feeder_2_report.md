> 🔵 **[I.PRE.SINGLE_SOURCE]** Network has a single voltage source — single point of failure. Infeasibility of the source makes the entire network infeasible.

## 7. Provenance & Model Conventions

**Inferred convention:** LV_240V: mixed; implicit (Kron-style) grounding

| Voltage level | Wires | Buses with neutral |
|---------------|-------|-------------------:|
| LV_240V | mixed | 59 / 605 |

| Neutral grounding | Value |
|-------------------|------:|
| Buses with neutral | 59 |
| Neutral branches | 0 |
| Grounding points | 59 |
| Neutral sections | 59 |
| Floating sections | 0 |

**Linecode impedance classification:**

| Verdict | Count |
|---------|------:|
| distinct | 7 |

**OpenDSS default fingerprints:** 1 hit(s) — see findings

**Earthing system per galvanic zone:**

| Zone | Buses | Wires | Star point | Downstream earths | Likely system |
|------|------:|-------|------------|------------------:|---------------|
| 240.0 V | 605 | ≤3-wire | solid | 58 | indeterminate (3-wire / Kron-style implicit grounding) |

> 🔵 **[I.PROV.DSS_DEFAULT_LENGTH]** 1 of 604 line(s) have length exactly 1.0 among otherwise varied lengths — the OpenDSS default; these lengths were likely never set.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.IMPEDANCE_TRANSFORM_KR]** 7 three-wire linecode(s) match the impedance signature of Kron reduction — neutral row/column eliminated from the original four-wire Carson impedance matrix via Schur complement. Exact when every neutral is perfectly grounded; approximate with finite grounding. Zero-sequence behaviour is not captured by the three-wire representation.: lc2, lc3, lc4, lc5, lc6, lc7, lc8.

## 8. Spec Conformance & Benchmark Readiness

| Spec conformance | Value |
|------------------|------:|
| Conformance issues | 0 |
| Voltage sources (spec requires 1) | 1 |

| Structural integrity | Value |
|----------------------|------:|
| Reference issues | 0 |
| Dimension issues | 0 |
| Galvanic islands | 1 |
| Islands without voltage reference | 0 |
| Line impedance spread | 6320.0× |

| Benchmark readiness | Value |
|---------------------|------:|
| Objective well-posed | true |
| Only slack generation | true |
| Buses with \|V\| bounds | 0.0% |
| Buses with vpn / vpp / vsym bounds | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| Lines with thermal limits | 100.0% |

**Augmentation needed:**

- only slack generation — dispatch is trivial (loss minimisation); add dispatchable DERs with diverse costs and p/q bounds
- no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground)
- no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vsym_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF

> 🔵 **[I.BENCH.AUGMENTATION]** Case needs augmentation to be a non-trivial OPF benchmark: only slack generation — dispatch is trivial (loss minimisation); add dispatchable DERs with diverse costs and p/q bounds; no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground); no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vsym_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF.
