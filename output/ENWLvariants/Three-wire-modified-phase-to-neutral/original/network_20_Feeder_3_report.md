|---------|------:|
| near_balanced | 3 |

**OpenDSS default fingerprints:** 1 hit(s) — see findings

**Earthing system per galvanic zone:**

| Zone | Buses | Wires | Star point | Downstream earths | Likely system |
|------|------:|-------|------------|------------------:|---------------|
| 240.0 V | 835 | ≤3-wire | solid | 0 | indeterminate (3-wire / Kron-style implicit grounding) |

> 🔵 **[I.PROV.SEQ_DERIVED]** 2 linecode(s) have exactly balanced impedance matrices (equal self, equal mutual entries) — likely constructed from sequence parameters (r1,x1,r0,x0) or a transposition assumption, not from conductor geometry: LC8, LC9.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.NO_PI_SHUNT]** All 5 linecode(s) have no π-shunt admittance (G_from/B_from/G_to/B_to absent or zero) — the line model reduces to a series impedance only. Shunt capacitance is typically negligible for short LV cables but may be significant for long MV/HV lines.
> 🟡 **[W.PROV.IMPLICIT_GROUNDING]** No branch carries a neutral conductor, but 59 bus(es) have components referencing terminal 'n' without an explicit grounding — the model implicitly assumes every bus is grounded (Kron-style convention). Make this assumption explicit.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.DSS_DEFAULT_LENGTH]** 1 of 834 line(s) have length exactly 1.0 among otherwise varied lengths — the OpenDSS default; these lengths were likely never set.
> 🔵 **[I.PROV.IMPEDANCE_TRANSFORM_MPN]** 5 three-wire linecode(s) match the impedance signature of modified phase-to-neutral approximation — both R and X blocks are circulant with mutual ≈ ½ self. X is further symmetrised relative to the standard phase-to-neutral form, introducing additional modelling error particularly for asymmetric cable geometries.: LC1, LC5, LC6, LC8, LC9.

## 8. Spec Conformance & Benchmark Readiness

| Spec conformance | Value |
|------------------|------:|
| Conformance issues | 0 |
| Voltage sources (spec requires 1) | 1 |

| Structural integrity | Value |
|----------------------|------:|
| Reference issues | 0 |
| Dimension issues | 0 |
| Galvanic islands | 1 |
| Islands without voltage reference | 0 |
| Line impedance spread | 2280.0× |

| Benchmark readiness | Value |
|---------------------|------:|
| Objective well-posed | false |
| Only slack generation | false |
| Buses with \|V\| bounds | 0.0% |
| Buses with vpn / vpp / vpos bounds | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| Lines with thermal limits | 100.0% |
| Generators with no DOF (p\_min≈p\_max) | 0 |
| Generators with zero cost (dispatchable) | 0 |
| Same-cost generator pairs (≤1 hop) | 0 |
| Loads with zero p\_nom | 0 |

**Augmentation needed:**

- no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs
- no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground)
- no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF

> 🔵 **[I.BENCH.AUGMENTATION]** Case needs augmentation to be a non-trivial OPF benchmark: no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs; no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground); no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF.

- **[I.PRE.NO_VOLT_BOUNDS]** `bus`  
  835 bus(es) have no voltage bounds — voltage will be unconstrained at these buses.
- **[I.PRE.SINGLE_SOURCE]** `network`  
  Network has a single voltage source — single point of failure. Infeasibility of the source makes the entire network infeasible.
- **[I.SCHEMA.VERSION_UNKNOWN]** `network`  
  Spec version 'unknown' has no bundled JSON Schema; structural validation skipped. Unknown-field catalogue still runs.
- **[I.RED.MERGEABLE_LINES]** `line`  
  59 group(s) of series lines (669 lines total) can be merged — intermediate buses have no other connections.
- **[I.BENCH.AUGMENTATION]** `network`  
  Case needs augmentation to be a non-trivial OPF benchmark: no priced slack or generator — the generation-cost objective is degenerate; add a cost to the voltage source at the source bus (augment_case does this by default) or dispatchable DERs; no voltage magnitude bounds on any bus — voltage is unconstrained; add v_min/v_max (phase-to-ground); no phase-to-neutral or sequence voltage bounds (vpn_*/vpos_*) — sequence bounds also improve solver robustness for 4-wire OPF.
